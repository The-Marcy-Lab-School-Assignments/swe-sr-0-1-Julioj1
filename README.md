## Prompt 1

A good technical explanation often uses a metaphor to help others understand a complex concept. Choose a metaphor to represent a Git commit. 

In a few brief paragraphs, use your chosen metaphor to explain:
* What a commit is
* How a commit is created (include the command-line syntax)
* Why commits are useful in version control.
* Why it is important to write descriptive clear messages in team settings.

### Response 1
A commit is a commentary on your work, whenever you are gonna log off for the day and want to save everything you did like this day I finished two taks tasks 1 and 2.

The way you create a commit is by writing in the command line in your terminal git commit -m "" the message that you want to save as the comment should be put inside the "" like: git commit -m "I answered question 1 and 2" and that sums up what you have done till now.

Commits are important in version control because after you have finished question 1 and 2 the next day that you are gonna continue your work you will see your commit and that you already did this questions so you are gonna go ahead and continue with the rest.

Descriptive clear messages are important because if you are doing this questions in a team and just put as the commit: git commit -m "Completed a question" the other person is gonna be like what question? what are the questions that are left to complete. Or you and your partner have to do multiple functions and you commit: git commit -m "Completed some functions" what functions did you complete how many are left or you say: git commit -m "deleted something in a function and added something else" what function did you change and why? was it really neccesary? you need to specify I chnaged this function because it was giving undefined and I changed "this" in order to fix the function that way I now know oh my function was giving undefined because of this and now I know how to not make that mistake again in the future.
